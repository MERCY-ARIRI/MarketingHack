# WhatsApp Marketer

## **Project Overview**
**WhatsApp Marketer** is a localized marketing solution designed for African small and medium businesses (SMBs) to simplify customer acquisition, engagement, and retention.

## **Problem Statement**

African SMBs face unique challenges in marketing and customer engagement:

1. **Limited access to affordable, localized marketing tools** — most solutions are global and do not cater to local market nuances.  
2. **Inefficient communication channels** — managing multiple channels manually wastes time and reduces effectiveness.  
3. **Lack of actionable insights** — businesses struggle to track campaign performance and optimize outreach.  

**Result:** Lost potential customers, higher outreach costs, and missed opportunities for personalized engagement.
